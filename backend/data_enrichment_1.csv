I am a strong believer that innovation doesn’t need to be brewed in a lab. It comes from the most regular processes. All it needs is thinking out of the box, or rather looking at things from a different perspective. I am passionate about solving real-life problems at scale and I believe that technology is the big enabler in making this a reality, at a much lower cost.

My career has been built and modeled on my beliefs and passion and the biggest proof point is my journey with Bajaj Finance Ltd, where I converted a service business into the product offering. I am very proud to have lead the team which created the EMI Card, which is a unique offering globally, making loan experience friction free.

Indians have global aspiration but need local solutions. I have successfully re-modeled global sales finance business for India thereby creating the largest NBFC in the last 10 years. 

But there is still a lot of room for innovation in the financial services space and we are just getting started. So I am taking another pivot in my career and exploring new technology tools in customer interaction to harness the next $B opportunity in servicing billion Indians.",,,,,,,,,,
